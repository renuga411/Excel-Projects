The Supermarket Sales Dashboard project focuses on analyzing and visualizing sales performance using Microsoft Excel. The main objective of this project is to provide an interactive and easy-to-understand view of supermarket sales data to support effective business decision-making. The dataset includes key parameters such as product categories, sales amount, profit, quantity sold, payment methods, customer type, and branch locations.

Data cleaning and preparation were performed using Excel functions and tools such as sorting, filtering, and conditional formatting. Pivot tables and pivot charts were used to summarize the data and create dynamic reports. Various visualization elements like bar charts, pie charts, line graphs, and slicers were incorporated into the dashboard to represent total sales, average profit, and performance comparisons across different branches and product lines.

The dashboard enables users to identify top-performing products, analyze customer purchasing patterns, and evaluate sales trends over time. By converting raw data into meaningful insights, this Excel-based dashboard supports better planning, inventory control, and marketing strategies. Overall, the project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be effectively used for data analysis, visualization, and business intelligence in the retail sector.
